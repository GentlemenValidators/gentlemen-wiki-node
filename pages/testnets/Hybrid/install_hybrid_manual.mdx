## Introduction

This project aims to provide installation, running, and maintenance capabilities of Hybrid validator node for potential and existing Hybrid Blockchain backers. The consensus structure of this chain is delegated proof of stake "DPos" and is governed by the symbiosis of Hybrid's implementation of go-ethereum and our system contracts. This repository has multiple release candidates inline so we recommend checking for updates for better functions and stability.

## Prerequisites

Operating System: Ubuntu >= 20.04 LTS

RAM: 8GB minimum, 32GB recommended

Persistent Storage: 25GB minimum, 100GB high-speed SSD recommended


### Step 1: Update and Upgrade
```bash copy
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt -y install build-essential tree
```
### Step 2: Clone git repository
```bash sudo
  git clone https://github.com/buildonhybrid/Core-Blockchain.git
  cd Core-Blockchain
```

### Step 3: Install Golang
```bash copy
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

echo 'export GOPATH=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

### Step 4: Build Geth

```bash copy
  cd node_src
  make all
```

### Step 3: Create directory and write password
```bash copy
mkdir ./chaindata/node1
cd node1
nano pass.txt
```

### Step 5: Install Geth Key
This step is very important. Input a password that will be used for a newly created validator account. In next step you will recieve a public key for your validator account"
Once a validator account is created using your given password, I'll give you where the keystore file is located so you can import it in metamask

```bash copy
./node_src/build/bin/geth --datadir ./chaindata/node1 account new --password ./chaindata/node1/pass.txt
touch ./chaindata/node1/.validator
```
