## Introduction

This project aims to provide installation, running, and maintenance capabilities of Hybrid validator node for potential and existing Hybrid Blockchain backers. The consensus structure of this chain is delegated proof of stake "DPos" and is governed by the symbiosis of Hybrid's implementation of go-ethereum and our system contracts. This repository has multiple release candidates inline so we recommend checking for updates for better functions and stability.

### Prerequisites

Operating System: Ubuntu >= 20.04 LTS

RAM: 8GB minimum, 32GB recommended

Persistent Storage: 25GB minimum, 100GB high-speed SSD recommended


### Step 1: Update and Upgrade
```bash copy
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt -y install build-essential tree
```
### Step 2: Clone git repository
```bash sudo
  git clone https://github.com/buildonhybrid/Core-Blockchain.git
  cd Core-Blockchain
```

### Step 3: Install Golang
```bash copy
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

echo 'export GOPATH=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

### Step 4: Build Geth

```bash copy
  cd node_src
  make all
```

### Step 3: Create directory and write password
```bash copy
mkdir ./chaindata/node1
cd node1
nano pass.txt
```

### Step 5: Install Geth Key
This step is very important. Input a password that will be used for a newly created validator account. In next step you will recieve a public key for your validator account"
Once a validator account is created using your given password, I'll give you where the keystore file is located so you can import it in metamask

```bash copy
./node_src/build/bin/geth --datadir ./chaindata/node1 account new --password ./chaindata/node1/pass.txt
touch ./chaindata/node1/.validator
```


## Start Node

### Export Variables
```bash copy
curl eth0.me
export IP=<You external IP>
export CHAINID=1224
export BOOTNODE="enr:-KO4QB_Jll8CKCu5vWCuwWqnNZekuL1WQ04dQOy_0kOv8wOlObJMtUScAnq_JwUwk_wCzxgC00oopO2g4aBsFn1F0SeGAY1lNDlEg2V0aMfGhEkzNGGAgmlkgnY0gmlwhJ9BFguJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQPGBUUpxPsTSIzIpDWapDOcGCg2XlhnmbQPnLKkrm9d5YRzbmFwwIN0Y3CCf5yDdWRwgn-c"
```

### Create SystemD File
```bash copy
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/hybrid.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]

```

```bash copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable hybrid.service
sudo systemctl start hybrid.service
```

## Importkey on MetaMask

### Change Directory and copy Json file
```bash sudo
cd /root/Core-Blockchain/chaindata/node1/keystore
```
Cat you json file and save
```bash
cat  UTC--*... | jq .
```
### Import to Metamask

    Access MetaMask Wallet: Open your MetaMask wallet extension or app.

    Navigate to Settings: Click on the account avatar or menu icon usually located in the top-right corner of the MetaMask interface. From the dropdown menu, select "Settings."

    Select "Import Account": In the Settings menu, choose the option labeled "Import Account."

    Choose File: You'll be prompted to select a file from your device. Locate the JSON file containing your private key, and click "Open" to select it.

    Enter Password (if applicable): If your JSON file is encrypted with a password, MetaMask will prompt you to enter the password associated with the file.

    Review Account Details: After successfully unlocking the JSON file, MetaMask will display the details of the account, including the address associated with the private key. Review the information to ensure it matches your expectations.

    Confirm Import: Once you've reviewed the details, click "Import" or "Confirm" to proceed with importing the account.

    Backup: After importing, ensure you securely store your private key or seed phrase. Consider writing down the private key on paper and storing it in a safe place offline.

    Security Considerations: Importing a private key exposes your funds to potential security risks. Ensure that you trust the source of the JSON file and take necessary precautions to protect your private keys from unauthorized access.

    Access Imported Account: After importing, the newly imported account will appear among your MetaMask accounts. You can now use this account to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) or manage your digital assets.
